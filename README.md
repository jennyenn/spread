<strong> Project 2: Spread </strong>


Hello! We are Jenny & Hannah!!
This is our second project for Typography and Interaction for our MPS Communication Design Project in the Fall of 2024.

We worked together to design, code, and refine this website based on the article by Nicole Felton, "Words as Material."

It was a lot of fun, we had a lot of ideas and worked well collaborating together. This was our first time using grid, flex, and animation for a web project.
